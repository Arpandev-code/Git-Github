    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>The first thing we need to do, is to check if Git is properly installed:

                Example
                git --version
                git version 2.30.2.windows.1
                If Git is installed, it should show something like git version X.Y</li>
            <li>Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:

                Example
                git config --global user.name "XYZ"
                git config --global user.email "xyz@gmail.com"
                Change the user name and e-mail address to your own. You will probably also want to use this when registering to GitHub later on.</li>
            <li>Creating Git Folder
                Now, let's create a new folder for our project:
                
                Example
                mkdir myproject
                cd myproject
                mkdir makes a new directory.
                
                cd changes the current working directory.
                
                Now that we are in the correct directory. We can start by initializing Git!</li>
            <li>Initialize Git
                Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder:
                
                Example
                git init 
                Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/myproject/.git/
                You just created your first Git Repository!</li>
            <li>git clone:

                Description: Clones a repository into a new directory.
                Usage: git clone repository_url</li>
            <li>git add:

                Description: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
                Usage: git add (file) or git add . (to add all changes)</li>
                <li>git status:

                    Description: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
                    Usage: git status</li>
                <li>git log:

                    Description: Displays the commit history.
                    Usage: git log</li>
                <li>git branch:

                    Description: Lists existing branches or creates a new branch.
                    Usage: git branch or git branch branch_name</li>
                <li>git checkout:

                    Description: Switches to a different branch or restores working tree files.
                    Usage: git checkout branch_name or git checkout file</li>
                <li>git merge:

                    Description: Combines changes from one branch into another.
                    Usage: git merge branch_name</li>
        </ul>
